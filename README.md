# Silent Crash: AsyncStorage Access Before Initialization in Expo

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in Expo applications involving AsyncStorage. The app crashes silently without providing helpful error messages in the console. This occurs when AsyncStorage is accessed prematurely before its proper initialization. This is particularly problematic when dealing with deep links or initial app loads.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the crash (lack of console errors makes diagnosis challenging).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring AsyncStorage is properly initialized before any access attempts.  This often requires employing a loading screen or using a state management solution to handle asynchronous operations elegantly.
